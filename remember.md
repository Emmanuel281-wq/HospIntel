As a seasoned hospital owner in Nigeria—someone who has dealt with diesel shortages, fiber cuts in Lekki, and software vendors who promise the moon but disappear after payment—I would lean back in my chair, look at your team, and say the following.

### What I Will Say (The Verdict)

"Gentlemen, I will be honest with you. Your presentation is slick. The website looks like something I would see at a conference in Dubai or London. It screams 'World Class,' and I appreciate that you respect my time enough to present something polished.

You have correctly identified the single biggest headache in my operations: **Connectivity**. My current EMR freezes every time the microwave link goes down during the rainy season. The fact that you are leading with 'Offline-First' and 'Mesh Networking' tells me you actually understand the African infrastructure reality, unlike those vendors trying to sell me cloud-only solutions from Europe that require 100% uptime.

However, I see you are a new company. In this business, 'New' is a risk factor. If my MRI machine breaks, I lose money. If my OS breaks, people die. You are asking me to rip out my central nervous system and replace it with a prototype.

I like the 'Sovereignty' talk—NDPR compliance is keeping me up at night—and I like that you are based here in Lagos. But pretty animations on a screen don't save lives. I need to know if this thing creates order or chaos on my ward floor."

### The Questions I Will Ask (The Interrogation)

I would then grill you on four specific pillars: **Resilience, Operations, Migration, and Business Continuity.**

#### 1. Technical Resilience (The "Offline" Claim)
*   "You say 'Zero Downtime,' but I know that is marketing talk. Walk me through the **exact failure scenario**. If my main server room in Yaba floods and the internet is cut, can a nurse in the ICU at my VI branch *actually* pull up a patient's drug allergies instantly? Not 'eventually'—instantly?"
*   "This 'Local Sync' you talk about—does it require expensive servers on-site? Do I need to buy new hardware, or will this run on the Dell desktops we bought five years ago?"
*   "What happens when two doctors edit the same patient record while offline? Your website mentions 'Conflict-Free' merging. Explain that to me in English. If Dr. A prescribes Aspirin and Dr. B prescribes Warfarin while disconnected, does the system alert us before we kill the patient?"

#### 2. Operations & Human Factor
*   "My nurses are overworked. They don't have time to learn a spaceship interface. Your 'Command Palette' (Cmd+K) looks cool for techies, but can a 50-year-old Matron use this with one hand while holding a crying baby? How much training is required?"
*   "You listed 'Role-Based Access.' Can I lock this down so that my billing department cannot see clinical notes, and my junior doctors cannot discharge patients without a consultant's digital signature?"

#### 3. Migration (The Nightmare)
*   "I have 15 years of patient data in an old SQL database and thousands of paper files. Your website talks about a 'Structured Data Import.' Who does the work? Do *you* have the staff to sit there and clean up dirty data, or are you expecting my IT guy to do it?"
*   "Can we run this in parallel? I am not switching off my old system on Monday morning and praying this works. I want to run HospIntel in just the Outpatient Department (OPD) for 3 months before touching the Wards. Is your system modular enough for that?"

#### 4. The Business Proposal (The "New Company" Risk)
*   "Since I am your first major client, I am effectively your beta tester. I am taking all the risk. Why should I pay full enterprise pricing? What allows me to trust that you won't run out of funding in 18 months and leave me with unsupported software?"
*   "Your website directs support to email (`inquiries.hospintel@gmail.com`). For an enterprise system, that worries me. If the system crashes at 2:00 AM on a Sunday, do I have a phone number? Will a human being pick up?"

### My Decision

"If you can show me a live demo—right now, on this laptop, without internet—where you shut off the WiFi, admit a patient, turn the WiFi back on, and show it syncing to my phone... then we can talk about a pilot program in my smallest clinic. But I want to see the *engine*, not just the paint."
